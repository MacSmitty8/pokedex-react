# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Pokedex React App

This is an app that utilizes the Pokemon API to display Pokemon names, abilities, and stats.

## Issues

One issue in particular I've had issues with is that the API kept on duplicating the stuff from the API when it loads the webpage for the first time. However if you click on the "next" button it displays everything with no duplicates, and if you return to the first page by clicking previous it also displays the list of Pokemon properly.

This also wasn't my original idea. I planned on using the official Marvel API to display comic book characters but had a hard displaying the information. It was scrapped for the MCU API, which was a fanmade one, and lacked images. Having a hard to displaying that one as well, I eventually did a new project entirely.
